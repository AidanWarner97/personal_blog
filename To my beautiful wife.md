I know I do this a lot, but I need to start by saying I'm sorry.
### I'm sorry.  So, so sorry

I miss you.  I miss being the person that you fell in love with back in 2017.
I want to be back home with you.

But I'm scared.  I'm currently scared of my own head and my feelings to be able to think properly and help myself in the best way possible.  And that is why I say that I need to be able to focus on fixing my own head before anything else.  

I love you.  More than anything (other than the kids which I know you're the same with).
If I could have a magic wand and fix everything, I would use it pretty much every single day.
